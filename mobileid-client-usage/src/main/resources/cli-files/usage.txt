Usage: ./bin/mid-client.sh [ARGUMENTS]

Arguments:
    -init                                               - Create sample configuration files in the current folder

    -config=my-config.properties                        - The properties file that provides the extra configuration parameters.
                                                          Use -init to create a sample file. If you don't specify a file,
                                                          by default config.properties is looked for in the start directory

    -profile-query                                      - Run a profile query on the target MSISDN. Cannot be used together with -sign

    -sign                                               - Request a digital signature to the target MSISDN. Arguments such as -lang, -dtbs
                                                          can customize what is displayed to the user and what is the signed content.
                                                          Cannot be used together with -profile-query

    -sync                                               - For sign operation. Run the signature in synchronous mode (default is async)

    -async                                              - For sign operation. Run the signature in asynchronous (polling) mode (this is the default)

    -receipt                                            - For sign operation. Send a receipt after the signature is acquired successfully

    -msisdn=41790000000                                 - The target MSISDN for the chosen operation

    -lang=en|de|it|fr                                   - The language to use during the talk with the mobile user. Choose from "en", "de", "it", "fr"

    -dtbs="Please sign this document"                   - The data to be signed (text). Make sure to use quotes around the entire argument,
                                                          since this text will usually contain spaces.
                                                          By default this argument is "Test: Please sign this document"

    -rest                                               - Use the REST interface. Cannot be used together with -soap. This is the default interface

    -soap                                               - Use the SOAP interface. Cannot be used together with -rest (default is REST)

    -help                                               - This help text

    -v                                                  - Be verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to info)

    -vv                                                 - Be EXTRA verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to debug, without HTTP and TLS traffic)

    -vvv                                                - Be EXTRA-EXTRA verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to debug, with HTTP and TLS traffic)

Notes:
    - for the arguments that take values, you can either use the form [-param=value] or [-param value].
      E.g.: ./bin/mid-client.sh -sign -msisdn=41790000000 ...... OR
            ./bin/mid-client.sh -sign -msisdn 41790000000 ......

Use cases:
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh -init                        => Have the config files generated for you in the current folder (optional step)
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh -profile-query -msisdn=41790000000
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh -profile-query -msisdn=41790000000 -soap
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh -sign -receipt -msisdn=41790000000 -lang=en -dtbs="Please sign this document"
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh -sign -sync -receipt -msisdn=41790000000 -lang=en -dtbs="Please sign this document" -soap -vv
    - ./bin/mid-client.sh \
           -config=my-config.properties \
           -sign -sync -receipt \
           -msisdn=41790000000 \
           -lang=en -dtbs="Please sign this document" \
           -soap -vv
